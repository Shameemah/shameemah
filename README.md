# Project Three: Expanded Web Presence
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Building on your expanding web design abilities, you will revisit your single-page presence and expand it to a multi-page or multi-page-like presence that provides greater user engagement and a stronger representation of yourself (e.g., through an online portfolio of work) or your organization (e.g., by showcasing activities, members, etc.).
